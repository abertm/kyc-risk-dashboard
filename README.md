## Overview
This project demonstrates a **mock KYC (Know Your Customer) dashboard** built with Python, Streamlit, and Plotly.  
It showcases the creation of a synthetic customer dataset, risk flagging, verification status, and an interactive dashboard suitable for fintech or compliance environments.

- Filter customers by **country, verification status, and risk flag**  
- Search customers by **name or ID**  
- Key metrics displayed: **Total Customers, High/Low Risk, Verification Status Counts**  
- Interactive charts:  
  - Risk Flag Distribution (Pie Chart)  
  - Verification Status Distribution (Pie Chart)  
  - Customers by Country (Bar Chart)  
  - High/Low Risk Customers by Verification Status (Stacked Bar Chart)  

## Dataset
- Generated with [Faker] 
- Contains **1000 mock customers**  
- 9 columns: `first_name`, `last_name`, `dob`, `country_code`, `id_number`, `email`, `phone`, `risk_flag`, `status`  
- Binary `risk_flag`: `High` / `Low`  

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- [Streamlit] – interactive dashboard  
- [Pandas] – data manipulation  
- [Plotly Express] – visualizations  
- [Faker] – mock data generation
